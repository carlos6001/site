However, I've found that many existing products are excused for having poor designs because they are ordinary. I correct for this in my design practice by applying the same process and standards to every project I take on.</p>

                            As a part of the Hacker Fab at CMU, I was tasked with designing and testing a method for moving sillicon wafers. By retrofitting my design to a 3D printer gantry, the design would allow the lab to automate their transistor tapeout process.

                            I have a lovely aluminum Cannondale road bike from 1993, but after 30 years some of the plastic components have been broken. OEM replacements for the top-tube cable stays are near impossible to find online, and the best reproductions are 3D printed and pricey. I set out to redesign this print to be optimized for 3D printing and retrofit the existing mounting holes.

                            I've played bass for about 7 years. I have 2 fender Jazz Basses and love their looks on stage, but I often find their playability to be somewhat lacking. This isn't a huge surprise, the Jazz Bass has been relatively unchanged since its creation in 1960. My goal with this project was to improve playability of these instruments using additive manufacturing.
