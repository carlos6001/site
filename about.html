                <p>
                    I'm Carlos. I'm a mechanical engineer, and I solve problems through thoughtful design.
                    <br><br>In many cases, the best outcome for an engineered solution is to not be noticed.
                    While this might seem bleak, I take great pride in creating products that are intuitive enough to be made easily and used seamlessly.
                    In my own practice, ease of manufacturing and assembly inform my decision-making as much as intended functionality.
                    <br><br>When I'm not CADing, you'll find me cycling, playing computer games, and practicing the bass.

                    <h2>Fallout: New Vegas (2010)</h2>
                    <p>This is one of my favorite games of all time, so it should be no surprise that this isn't my first playthrough. 
                        Created by the same team as Fallout and Fallout 2, the game features the same wit and creativity in the writing
                        but trades the isometric perspecive of the originals for a first-person perspective. The ability of the open world
                        to adapt to player choices is unmatched by any game I have played since. </p>

                    <h2>The City and Its Uncertain Walls (2023)</h2>
                    <p>I have read a few of Murakami's works and have been consistently impressed. His ability to portray dream like qualities while
                        telling a focused story is a rarity among authors. I am reading this one a few chapters at a time in a book club with friends.
                        I have loved the story so far and am always excited to read more each week.
